# V_LABOR_METRICS SQL Script

## Overview

This SQL script, `V_LABOR_METRICS.sql`, is designed to manage and query labor metrics within a specified database environment. It aims to structure, aggregate, and possibly transform labor-related data to support analysis, reporting, and decision-making processes related to workforce management, productivity, and efficiency.

## Features

- **Creation of Views or Tables**: The script includes statements for creating a view that consolidate labor metrics from WMS data sources.
